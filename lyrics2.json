["Your momma's failed wheat field","Was a good place to lie down together","Three weeks deep into the guts of summer","We sweat like hogs and I felt light as a feather","I saw a disk-like object","Reflected in your eyes","And the noise grew louder","As we looked up to the skies","And the sleek silver body had lights along the side","And the sleek silver body had lights all underneath","I remember the warm air blowing in our faces","I remember the heat running through me","There was no one worth telling","There was nothing we could do","And I was real quiet as I lifted the keys from the kitchen table","I was looking right at you","And your hand brushed against mine","And it shook me inside","As all along the night sky","I watched our futures collide","And the car's new headlights cut through the darkness","As the oil dripped silently to the pavement underneath","I remember the warm air burning our faces","I remember the heat running through me","It was 9 AM when the U-Haul came","And I heard my momma call my name","My dad taught English at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo","He was at work that day","It was time to go","We were moving","I was 5 years old and my sister was 3","I was wondering what'd likely become of me","My sister looked sad and I tried to be strong","It was hard just to get up and move along","We were moving","By 5 in the afternoon we were gone","And my stepfather welcomed me with open arms","We walked right through that apartment door","I had never lived in an apartment before","It was weird","I'll probably never know what it was like that night","For my dad, but I'd wager it was pretty bad","My sister and me, we stayed up late","Talking in the dark, not feeling so great","We were moving","Out of our house","Into a two-story apartment building across town","With a swingset and a sandbox out in the parking lot","And a laundry room with four glistening washing machines","And two dryers","Keep the home fires","Burning","Keep the home fires","Burning","Keep the home, home fires","On the shores of a lake named after a late queen of England","I heard new rumors of war","The sun was a red ball up in the summer sky","I saw my sister standing in the doorway","She had that look on her face that reminded me of you","The reports were coming hourly and the sky was blue","They were shifting the power again","They always do this when I come home","I tucked my shirt in though I don't know why","Shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky","'Cause it was shining, blazing like a highway flare","In the incredibly, impossibly dry air","I heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again","And thought that everything was heading straight down the drain","They positioned themselves in strategic locations","I was beginning to lose my patience","If you'll just put your hand in mine","We're gonna leave all our troubles behind","I got my eye on the scar","That runs clear from your temple to your jawline","You'll tell me about all your thoughts right this minute","Then I will tell you mine","'Cause I got the wind in my hair","And I'm far away from where I used to be","But I got all my attention fixed on you","And you're flashing that smile at me","With the midwestern sky burning above us","We lean up against the car","I want to tell you what the sky has done to me","I want you to tell me who we are","'Cause I see you raising the water to your lips","It's the blazing dead center of July","And I got all my hopes hung on your one gorgeous promise","And you got the sunlight dancing on your eyes","And I got the wind in my hair","And I'm far away from where I used to be","But I got all my attention fixed on you","And you're just where you said you'd be","Just where you said you'd be","There was a guy up on the hill","With a trumpet to his lips","I mean to tell you he knew how to blow that thing","There were women dressed in purple","Banging on their tambourines","And hammering on cymbals","It was not that long ago","When we gathered in the valley below","I loved you more than I loved my own life","I was falling to pieces","There was a young man on the altar","You saw me poised above him","I saw you watching me","There were singers, there were dancers","There was glittering gold","Spring breaking out gradually","It was not that long ago","But the memory's kind of dying out, you know","Like a flower caught in the overgrowth","Falling, falling to pieces","Cold northern wind","And your young arm","Against my face","Soft and warm","There will always be an Ireland","There will always be an Ireland","Silent hour","Worthless words","View of some foreign city from the high window","Strange black birds","There will always be an Ireland","There will always be an Ireland","What we did","The things we said","Your hand resting","On my head","There will always be an Ireland","There will always be an Ireland","There will always be an Ireland","There will always be an Ireland","I saw the long row of bluebells","Saw the foxglove and the nightshade","I saw the whole garden and I thought a while about","How I've been waiting for you since the second grade","The flowers made the air boil","The boiling air made me think of you awhile","I did not come here to suffer","I did not come here to suffer","I heard the ducks all quacking","I saw the sunshine on the lake","Saw you standing near the water","And wondered how long I'd be paying for one dumb mistake","The sight of you was really something else","But I don't know what that something else was","I did not come here to suffer","I did not come here to suffer","Well, you walked into the party","Like you were walking onto a yacht","Your hat strategically dipped beneath one eye","Your scarf it was apricot","You had one eye on the mirror","And you watched yourself a lot","And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner","They'd be your partner, yeah","Well, you had me several years ago","When I was still quite naive","And you said that we made such a pretty pair","And that you would never leave","But you gave away the things you loved","And one of them was me","I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee","Clouds in my coffee, yeah","Well, I heard that you went off to Saratoga","And your horse naturally won","And then you charted a Learjet to Nova Scotia","To see the total eclipse of the sun","Yeah, you're always where you should be","And when you're not you're with","Some underworld spy or your best friend's boyfriend","Your best friend's boyfriend, yeah","The first new tree is tall and good","It gives hard, dark, brown, burning wood","For when winter comes; it stands right outside","With its blossom-laden arms spread wide","The second new tree gives out sweet, sticky fruit","And it took a long time to take root","Sometimes we thought it had given up the spirit","But now it makes me happy when I'm just standing near it","The third new tree stands just west of the barn","Its best branches no thicker than my arm","I will water him every day","And I will chase all the termites away","But the fourth new tree","Is my enemy","Yeah, the fourth new tree","Shouldn't be here","The fourth new tree","Sends its tendrils through the water mains and tries to poison me","Its leaves are thick and always falling","And pure","What's going to be the death of me","Static electricity","What's making me take it all too far","You are","You are","What's keeping me up at night","The street light","What's finally gonna let me sleep all right","You might","You might","How do I know what I know","Where did our love go","How come the river froze over this year","What are we hiding here","I saw you waiting by the mailbox","Saw the mailman come","Saw the neighbors poke their heads out of their windows","I saw everyone","When the sky was the color of cream","And you started leaving messages on my answering machine","Telling me that you were way across town","And would be home in a night or two","I started keeping track of my losses","There were only one or two I couldn't cover","And up there against the milk-white sky","I saw fleeting vestiges of you","The way you vanished gradually","Has made a bitter man of me","And the way you vanished gradually","Has made a bitter man of me","Where the ocean cleaves the rocks real clean","I dropped my answering machine","I watched the waves chew it into tiny little pieces","Saw the seafoam hissing in the air","On the balance sheet I'd been keeping in my mind, I entered","Two hundred kronors to the left of the debit line","It was what the machine had cost me","It was a greater loss than I could bear","I hear the wheels and knobs whirring down to this very day","Long after the ocean has washed it all away","I heard the train go by last night","And it's a slow train out of here all right","But the way you disappeared in slow degrees","Has made a very patient man of me","Yeah","went down the road today","Just in the old way","And a black dog hobbled past me","His tags jangled on his collar","It made me wish I was dead","It made me wish I was dead","And the familiar sun on me","Just like it would always be","Rocky soil, dry land","Knew it all like the back of my hand","It made me wish I was dead","It made me wish I was dead","Terrific view from here","Skies clear","Sun's high","I let things lie","And I know what is and isn't mine","And it was good to get back to the sunshine","But five years is a long time","And I spent five years in Sweden dying for you","I spent five years in Sweden","Dying for you","As we pull into the harbor in New York today","And I ask you how you're doing, you swear up and down you're OK","But I can see what's gotten into your eyes","It's written all over your face tonight","We will never see Ireland again","We will never see Ireland again","As we hang up the map on the motel wall","Count up the places that we've left behind, add the distances between them all","All the bridges someone's burned down for us","All the chances that we burned all by ourselves","Makes us wonder what we were thinking then","'Cause we will never see Ireland again","We will never see Ireland again","We will never see Ireland again","We got the brightest skyline","Like a vision of heaven on the evening sky","And a clocktower two blocks from the spot","Where I'm standing tonight","And the avenues are throbbing with people","And the late sunlight makes them all look like angels","And the transformation is seamless","They are unbearably bright","I can almost hear their voices","As I walk past them all toward the water","What is there left in a city like this","When everyone you know is gone","I saw the wind wash them all away","And I was freezing","Picked up a fat gold watch for you","Down where the river washes over the avenue","And I listened to it tick away the minutes","Looked out at the awful sky","I was afraid that my arm was broken","But it was only kind of run down","I went walking after 2 last night","Felt like I was the only guy in town","And I'm not, I know","And I don't need you to tell me so","Look at this watch","Look at this watch","You won't believe what this thing can do","When my old friend came crawling up the hill","Broken and bloody","Carrying her hair in clumps in her hands","I let her right on in","I let her right in","When she stood near the kitchen window","Staring out at the countryside","And then she looked my way","I let her right on in","I let her right in","And when she was stronger than she'd been before","I opened the front door","And I opened the back door","And the sunlight poured in","Yeah","No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps","No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep","No one learns the secret name","No one burns in the absent flame","No one broke DB Cooper's fall","No one hopes to hear the bagman call","Children piping in the main square","But no one's dancing, no one's dancing down there","The river goes where the water flows","But no one knows when the Batcave closed","The river goes where the water flows","But no one knows when the Batcave closed","No promise sweeter than a blood pact","Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act","No morning colder than the first frost","No friends closer than the ones we've lost","Nothing sharper than a serpent's tooth","Nothing harder than the gospel truth","Though you repent and don sackcloth and try to make nice","You can't cross the same river twice","The river goes where the water flows","But no one knows when the Batcave closed","The river goes where the water flows","But no one knows when the Batcave closed","There's a club where you'd like to go","You could meet someone who's lost like you","Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves","Fumble through the fog for a season or two","No town more barren than our town","No haven safer than the one they tore down","No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend","No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end","No one knows where the lone wolf's gone","No one sees him camped out right there on the front lawn","We played for you but you would not sing","No one was going to get away with anything","The river goes where the water flows","But no one knows when the Batcave closed","The river goes where the water flows","But no one knows when the Batcave closed","There's indifference on the wind, but a faint gust of hope","At a club nobody goes to with a musty velvet rope","Guys in Motörhead jackets who knew him way back when","Haven't raised a drink in years but now meet up again","To remember how it was when they all thought they'd move away","And ride in Lotus Sevens through the London streets one day","Nobody ever gets away","Even the best of us come back some day","To the unmarked rooms where the dry dust breeds","Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds","There's a rusted fog machine in a concrete storage space","Letter-number combinations with no meaning on its face","They won't make these any more, it's a wooden coach-and-four","No one will even steal it if you leave it by the door","With no sign to mark its going, no tombstone for its grave","There will be goodbyes by dozens, so practice being brave","No one anticipates the rush","The breezy feeling of the faceless crush","At the ends of things where the salvage bleeds","Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds","They don't throw him a parade","He just comes in on a train","One suitcase in his hand","And an old army backpack","From the second World War","From a Leipzig second-hand store","Pick the keys up from the agent, everything's been taken care of","No big changes in the roadways since you left that I'm aware of","A few old buildings gone to dust, and some new ones in the way","They'll look just like the old ones when the winds have had their say","See the children bound for London, you'll all be back too","Everybody tests the membrane, but no one pushes through","Come on boys, that'll be enough","You'd think your old friends wouldn't play so tough","Like a basket by the Nile hiding down among the reeds","Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds","In the secret caverns underneath West Covina","Half desperate for peace with the surface dwellers","But coming to no conclusions","And now we

live","Picked the lock on the front door","And felt it give","Touch nothing, move nothing, stand still","Keep my ears open for cars","See how the people here live now","Hope that they're better at it than I was","I used to live here","I used to live here","I used to live here","I used to live here","Pictures up on the mantle","Nobody I know","I stand by the tiny furnace","Where the long shadows grow","Living room to bedroom to kitchen","Familiar and warm","Hours we spent starving within these walls","Sounds of a distant storm","I used to live here","I used to live here","I used to live here","I used to live here","Fight through the ghosts in the hallway","Duck and weave","Stand by the door with my eyes closed","When it's time to leave","Steal home before sunset","Cover up my tracks","Drive home with old dreams that play in my mind","And the wind at my back","Break the lock on my own garden gate","When I get home after dark","Sit looking up at the stars outside","Like teeth in the mouth of a shark","I used to live here","I used to live here","I used to live here","I used to live here","The path to the awful room","That no one will sleep in again","Was lit for one man only","Gone where none can follow him","Try to look down","The way he'd gone","Back of the closet whose depths go on","And on and on","Nice people said he was with God now","Safe in his arms","But the voices of the angels that he heard on his last days with us","Smoke alarms","Well, the path to the palace of wisdom","That the mystics walk","Is lined with neuroleptics","And electric shocks","Hope daily for healing","Try not to go insane","Dance in a circle with bells on","Try to make it rain","And nice people said he had gone home to God now","Safe in his arms, safe in his arms","But the voices of the angels singing to him in his last hours with us","Smoke alarms, smoke alarms","Masks hanging on the tomb walls","Where the coven grieves","Witches hiding in the brambles","Ground level down by the dry leaves","Blow and burn slowly","No ground is ever gonna hold me","White candles in the manor","Where the curse takes hold","Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl","Make your own friends when the world's gone cold","It gets dark and then","I feel certain I am going to rise again","If not by faith then by the sword","I'm going to be restored","Build the fires to keep the beacon flashing","Where the earth lies flat","Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down","Invent my own family if it comes to that","Hold them close, hold them near","Tell them no one's ever going to hurt them here","Steal the treasure and try to leave town","Fight my way back down","Don't want to hurt anyone","Probably gonna have to before it's all done","Take to the hills, run away","I'm going to get my perfect body back someday","If not by faith then by the sword","I'm going to be restored","For several days the visitors were here","We saw them turn down and we watched them disappear","Talked about the days they'd said were sure to come","Had a hard time believing","I remember seeing you, my tongue struck dumb","When you first came here from wherever it was you came from","The power in your voice, your rough touch","You keeping care of me, keeping watch","Open up the doors to the tent","Wonder where the good times went","I will do what you ask me to do","Because of how I feel about you","I saw his little face contract as his eyes met light","Try to imagine anything so bright","You only see it once and it steals until the dawn","And then it's gone forever","For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind","Harder days coming, maybe, I don't mind","Sounds kind of dumb when I say it but it's true","I would do anything for you","Open up the promise of the day","Drive the dark things away","I will do what you ask me to do","Because of how I feel about you","Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow I can't live like this","And in the shower I am a sailor standing waiting ready for the ship to list","Everything looks burned up I'm too scared to look around","Don't feel like going on but come on make a joyful sound","If you will believe in your heart","And confess with your lips","Surely you will be saved one day","Try to think of ways to fix myself but everything ends in a cul-de-sac","The beast broke from the barn while we were sleeping, face it, face it, he's not coming back","Don't see what the point is in even trying to fight","Look for the bigger picture when I close my eyes real tight","If you will believe in your heart","And confess with your lips","Surely you will be saved one day","Look for the sign of Daniel","Consider the clues","Wait as long as I have to for good news","Wake and rise and face the day and try to keep the day from staring back at me","Busy hours for joyful hearts and maybe later head out to the pharmacy","Won't take the medication but it's good to have around","A kind and loving God won't let my small ship run aground","If you will believe in your heart","And confess with your lips","Surely you will be saved one day","In the holding tank I built for myself","It's feeding time","And I start to feel afraid 'cause I'm the last one left in line","The endless string of summer storms that led me to today","Began one afternoon with you long ago and far away","And someone leads the beast in on its chain","But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain","So I won't be afraid of anything ever again","In the cell that holds my body back","The door swings wide","And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside","And if the clouds are gathering it's just to point the way","To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day","And someone leads the beast in on its chain","But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain","So I won't be afraid of anything ever again","They'd hooked you up","To a fentanyl drip","To mitigate the pain a little bit","I flew in","From Pennsylvania","When I heard the hour was coming fast","And I docked in Santa Barbara","Tried to brace myself","But you can't brace yourself when the time comes","You just have to roll with the blast","And I'm an eighteen-wheeler headed down the interstate","And my brakes are gonna give and I won't know till it's too late","Tires screaming when I lose control","Try not to hurt too many people when I roll","Find the Harbor Freeway","And head south","Real tired","Head kind of light","I found Telegraph Road","I'd only seen the name on envelopes","Found the parking lot","And turned right","I felt all the details","Carving out space in my head","Tropicanas on the walkway","Neon red","Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay","Stands a traveler going somewhere far away","And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing","Try to listen to my instruments, they don't say anything","People screaming when the engines quit","I hope we're all in crash position when we hit","And then came to your bedside","And as it turns out, I'm not ready","And as though you were speaking through a thick haze","You said hello to me","We all stood there around you","Happy to hear you speak","The last of something bright burning, still burning","Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy","And you were a presence full of light upon this earth","And I am a witness to your life and to its worth","It's three days later when I get the call","And there's nobody around to break my fall","The sun above me and the concrete floor below","Scratch at the chain links, maybe bare my teeth for show","Fed twice a day, I don't go hungry anymore","Feel in my bones just what the future has in store","I pace in circles so the camera will see","Look hard at my stripes, there'll be no more after me","Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark","Scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark","Smell something burning downwind just a little ways","They set up camp and sing and sweat and work for days","I have no fear of anyone, I'm dumb and wild and free","I am a flightless bird, and there'll be no more after me","In Costa Rica, in a burrow underground","Climb to the surface, blink my eyes, and look around","I'm all alone here as I try my tiny song","Claim my place beneath the sky but I won't be here for long","I sang all night the moon shone on me through the trees","No brothers left, and there'll be no more after me","If my prayer be not humble make it so","In these last hours, if the spirit waits in check, help me let it go","And should my suffering double let me never love you less","Let every knee be bent, and every tongue confess","And I won't get better but someday I'll be free","'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me","I read the magazines somebody brought","Hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot","And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes","The pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes","And I won't get better but someday I'll be free","'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me","If my prayer goes unanswered that's all right","If my path fills with darkness and there is no sign of light","Let me praise you for the good times, let me hold your banner high","Until the hills are flattened and the rivers all run dry","And I won't get better but someday I'll be free","'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me","The clouds explode and then the desert blooms","Someone will need to mop this floor for me","When I emerge I find my car","Like a cathedral in a dream of the future","Drive till the rain stops","Keep driving","Pull over and blast off when I get the chance","Clear as an insect's wings in sunlight","Flip on the high stakes radio","Try to sing the words right","Drive till the rain stops","Keep driving","I had his arms tied up behind him","We were together all day","Maybe make Culiacán by sunset","Try to anyway","High as the clouds now","Flying","Drive till the rain stops","Keep driving","I saw some old friends as I came to the city gate","They asked me where I'd been of late","I hadn't been anywhere, but what was I going to say","Two hopeful people, looking at me that way","You and your brother","You both escaped the curse","You can't comprehend what it's like","We stood in the sunlight, and they asked me where I'd been","Held the gate open, and told me to come on in","I saw the damp green grass, so nice on the other side","Couldn't explain myself to them, but I tried","You and your brother","You both escaped the curse","You can't comprehend what it's like","The ground was dry but giving, the sky was nearly black","Saw some old friends when I looked back","Remember my old home, haven't forgotten yet","What happens on the day when I forget","You and your brother","You both escaped the curse","You can't comprehend what it's like","Try to hide down in the darkness","Get accustomed to our shapes","Rained in 'til next week at the earliest","Go through an old box full of Betamax tapes","Pull the blankets up to my neck","And the screen began to glow","I cried real tears when they beat Chuck Norris down","Wait here in the shadows 'til the shadows let me go","And treat each crushing moment like a gift","And wait for the fog to lift","Pretend I'm waiting for a notice","From someone somewhere far away","Sit here and break things while I'm waiting","As day gives way to day gives way to day gives way to day","But while I try to let the shadows mask my movements","They're never gonna hide me like they used to","I watched the Delta Force save everybody from that plane on fire","I was watching wishing I had not lost track of you","I treat each crushing moment like a gift","And wait for the fog to lift","Fog lifts from the harbor","Dawn goes down today","An agent crests the shadows of a nearby alleyway","Piles of broken bricks","Signposts on the path","Every moment points towards the aftermath","Yeah","Sailors straggle back","From their nights out on the town","Hopeless urchins from the city","Gather around","Spies from Imperial China","Wash in on the tide","Every battle tends towards","Surrender on both sides","And I am coming home to you","With my own blood in my mouth","And I am coming home to you","If it's the last thing that I do","Bells ring in the tower","Wolves howl in the hills","Chalk marks show up","On a few high windowsills","And a rabbit gives up somewhere","And a dozen hawks descend","Every moment leads towards its own sad end","Yeah","Ships loosed from their moorings","Capsize and then are gone","Sailors without captains watch a while and then move on","And an agent crests the shadow","And I head in her direction","All roads lead towards","The same blocked intersection","I am coming home to you","With my own blood in my mouth","And I am coming home to you","If it's the last thing that I do","We got in your car and we hit the highway","Eastern sun was rising over the mountains","Yellow and blood-red bits","Like a kaleidoscope","And flaming swords may guard the Garden of Eden","But we consulted maps from earlier days","Dead languages on our tongues","Holding on to our last hope","And the day was bright and fine","And the highway sign","Said, San Bernardino welcomes you","I checked us into our hotel and filled the bathtub","And you got in the warm warm water","I pulled petals from my pocket","I loved you so much just then","And it was hard but you were brave, you are splendid","And we will never be alone in this world","No matter what they say","We're gonna be O.K.","We were safe inside","And our new son cried","San Bernardino welcomes you","Well they come and pull me from my house","And they drag my body through the streets","And the sun so hot I think I'll catch fire and burn up","In the summer air so moist and sweet","And the people all come out to cheer","Rocks in the pathway break my skin","And there's honeysuckle on the faint breeze today","With every breath I'm drawing in","I wanna cry out","But I don't scream and I don't shout","And I feel so proud to be alive","And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives","The crowds grow denser by the second","As we near the center of the town","And they dig a trench in the main square right there","And they pick me up and throw me down","And I start laughing like a child","And I mark their faces one by one","Transfiguration's gonna come for me at last","And I will burn hotter than the sun","I waited so long","And now I taste jasmine on my tongue","And I feel so proud to be alive","And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives","Lend me your hand","Let me look in your eyes","As my last chance to feel human","Begins to vaporize","Maybe it's the heat in here","Maybe it's the pressure","You oughtta head for the exits","The sooner the better","I am this great mass of blood and foam","And no one in her right mind","Would make my home her home","My heart's an autoclave","My heart's an autoclave","When I try to open up to you","I get completely lost","Houses swallowed by the earth","Windows thick with frost","And I reach deep down within","But the pathways twist and turn","And there's no light anywhere","And nothing left to burn","And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam","And no emotion that's worth having","Could call my heart its home","My heart's an autoclave","My heart's an autoclave","I dreamt that I was perched atop","A throne of human skulls","On a cliff above the ocean","Howling wind and shrieking seagulls","And the dream went on forever","One single static frame","Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name","And I am this great unstable mass of blood and foam","And no one in her right mind","Would make my home her home","My heart's an autoclave","My heart's an autoclave","There were signs up in the sky","When we gathered by the garden wall","Everybody on his best behavior","Listening for the altar call","High priest of Salem in his robes","Ranting at the coming of the day","Ravens at the gates","Frightening all the visitors away","I laid down by the water","Dreamed a dream of where I come from","Old things made new","Waiting for you","There were wooden wind chimes rustling","In the trees above the anthills on the dunes","On the high winds we could hear them","Old familiar tunes","The little bit of faith we had once","Like the memory of a movie","They got burned up in the great fire","Reassembling itself slowly but surely","I laid down by the water","Dreamed a dream of where I come from","Old things made new","Waiting for you","We were parked in your car","In our neutral meeting place","The Episcopalian churchyard","Ahaha","I had things I'd been meaning to say","But in the dazzling winter sun that late","I could feel them melt away","And through the warm radio static","I couldn't hear my stage directions","And the fog on the windshield","Obscured our sad reflections","Ahhaha","I felt so desperate in your arms","I felt so desperate in your arms","We were parked near some trees","And the moonlight soaked the branched","In ever deepening degrees","Had my hand in your hair","Trying to keep my cool","Til it became to much to bear","When we cracked the windows open","Well the air was just so sweet","We could hear the cars ten feet away","Out there on the street","I felt so desperate in your arms","I felt so desperate in your arms","I felt so desperate in your arms","If the strain proves too much","Give up right away","If the light hurts your eyes","Stay in your room all day","When the room fills with smoke","Lie down on the floor","In the declining years","Of the long war","Well the blood's in the water","And the shark's gonna come","And we swim in the dark","Until our bodies are numb","Blind desert rats in the moonlight","Too far from shore","In the declining years","Of the long war","Empty room with a lightbulb","Where the phone starts to ring","Everybody gets nervous","Nobody says anything","Next day someone's initials","Show up on the door","I think I'm gonna crack","Can't live like this anymore","Ugly things in the darkness","Worse things in store","In the declining years","Of the long war","It's gonna be too hot to breathe today","When everybody's out here on the streets","Somebody's opened up a fire hydrant","Cold water rushing out in sheets","Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey","Asked me for a cigarette","Companionship is where you find it","So I take what I can get","Hubcaps on the cars like funhouse mirrors","Stick to the shadows when I can","Lovecraft in Brooklyn","When the sun goes down the armies of the voiceless","Several hundred thousand strong","Come out without their bandages","Their voices raised in song","When the streetlights sputter out","They make this awful sizzling sound","I cast my face towards the pavement","Too many bloodstains on the ground","Rhode Island drops into the ocean","No place to call home anymore","Lovecraft in Brooklyn","Head outside most every day","To try to keep the wolves away","Imagine nice things I might say","If company should come","Woke up afraid of my own shadow","Like genuinely afraid","Headed for the pawnshop","To buy myself a switchblade","Someday something's coming","From way out beyond the stars","To kill us while we stand here","It'll store our brains in Mason jars","And then the girl behind the counter","She asks me how I feel today","I feel like Lovecraft in Brooklyn","Yeah","Children by the water banks","Laughing long and loud","Changbai's high fine western peaks","Just beneath the clouds","Currents in the water","Churning in their course","Body of a sea lion","Head just like a horse","Preacher in the soft brown sand","Begins to speak his piece","High winds in the treetops","Low flying winter geese","No one taking pictures","Everybody's still","And then the water sought its course again","The way that waters will","No one at the lakeside now","Moon up in the sky","Night birds in the dragon spruce","Moaning long and high","Back stroking on the surface","Moonlight on its face","Floats the Tianchi monster","Staring into space","Out around the temple now","Narcissus in bloom","Censers packed with sandalwood","Send smoke into the room","Children in the sand outside","On their hands and knees","Sketching pictures all day long","Of stranger things than these","Got out of bed","Could not remember my own name","Condemned to walk the soil","Amongst all creatures wild and tame","Go where I go","Do what I must","Crawl starving on my belly","Licking up the dry dust","I see the light in your window","Ride the elevator to the sixth floor","Stand with my arms at my sides","As you open up the door","But I'm out of my element","I can't breathe","I'm out of my element","I can't breathe","Alone with your bathroom mirror","Try to get my head straight","Breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear","Clean slate","Meet up with you in the kitchen","Where the air is hot and dry","Open up all the faucets","Be fruitful and multiply","I stand where the flashing swords gleam","And I try to shake my head clear of the dream","But I'm out of my element","I can't breathe","I'm out of my element","I can't breathe","I start to sweat I can't cool down","I'm scared of all the strangers in this town","I try to tell you just why I've come","It's like I've got molasses on my tongue","I made it through town somehow","But who's gonna save me now","I'm out of my element","I can't breathe","I'm out of my element","I can't breathe","Slumped up against the sink","Hair plastered to her cheeks","Marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin","Refugee from a disco in old East Berlin","Weightless","Formless","Blameless","Nameless","Stray syllables were gurgling","From her throat one at a time","Face hidden from my view","I let myself imagine she was you","Only weightless","Formless","Blameless","Nameless","And when I washed my hands","I ran the water hotter than I could stand","Half rising to a crouch","Sinking back down to the floor","In your walking keep your head low","Try to leave no traces when you go","Stay weightless","Formless","Blameless","Nameless","Long dinner with some friends","Way out way out in Portmore","Servants of the pharaoh","Slip in through an open door","All business","Bearing knives and zip guns","So get on the floor now","Every last one","Every last one","The heat drifts","Across the land","If I forget you Israel","Let me forget my right hand","And on the floor Michael James Williams","Feels his fingers start to freeze","And the whole scene's like a movie","Paramedics on their knees","Try, try your whole life","To be righteous and be good","Wind up on your own floor","Choking on blood","The heat drifts","Across the land","If I forget you Israel","Let me forget my right hand","And the house stills smells like onions","When the ambulance arrives","Gabriel in postal blue","Loads up the car and drives","To Spanish Town","About three miles away","Where will the wicked run to","On that last day","On that last day","The heat drifts","Across the land","If I forget you Israel","Let me forget my right hand","I am ready for my closeup today","Too long I've let my self respect stand in my way","Well the prom queen's","Caught in the high beams","And the string's keen","It's a big scene","But when the house goes up in flames","No one emerges triumphantly from it","When the scum begins to circle the drain","Everybody loves a winner","I spent eight hours in my makeup chair","Waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair","Well the fire's bright","And the the frame's tight","Try to get right","Well we've still got life","But when the house goes up in flames","No one emerges triumphantly from it","When the scum begins to circle the drain","Everybody loves a winner","But when the house goes up in flames","When the scum begins to circle the drain","Just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers","Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris","Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes","Don't even question your senses, you can be sure that's me","When all the pretenders to your hand","Lie dead across the land","I'll be the last man on earth","I'll be the last man on earth","I'll be the last man on earth","Crawling around","Down on the ground","When the Hail Marys you've been saying lose their savor","Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in","Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you","Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim","It was their love you wanted, not mine","But when they deny your name three times","I'll be the last man on earth","I'll be the last man on earth","I'll be the last man on earth","Crawling around","Down on the ground","And I will throw you across my shoulder","And I will bleed and I will drool","And the cameras will slow-pan across my face","And I will try to say something cool","Just as the hordes of thirsting demons close around us","Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun","Who will that guy be holding you so high above them","You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one","I may have failed you once before","But this right here, this means war","I'll be the last man on earth","I'll be the last man on earth","I'll be the last man on earth","Crawling around","Down on the ground","Out by the tracks, where the sunflowers grow high and fine","Three sets of tracks, Steve and Rochelle's, and the last one's mine","Guy with a hat down in the weeds in a cardboard box","Secrets to keep, records to seal up, kittens weighed down with rocks","There was a little toolshed","Where he made us suffer","Back at the school, everyone looks like the enemy","And we couldn't sleep, and I had the voices inside of me","Steve and Rochelle and me down the well all semester long","Back to the tracks to try and make peace but the box was gone, was gone","There was a little toolshed","Where the sad man made us suffer","I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside","Like a prisoner breaking out of jail","And I steal down to Business 15-501","Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail","And somebody stops to pick me up","But he drops me off just down the block","And along the highway where the empty spirits breathe","Wild sage growing in the weeds","Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps","Headed vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes","And I lose my footing and I skin my hands breaking my fall","And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies","And then I think I hear angels in my ears","Like marbles being thrown against a mirror","And along the highway where unlucky stray dogs bleed","Wild sage growing in the weeds","And some days I don't miss my family","And some days I do","Some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder","Most days I know it's not true","I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face","And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides","And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand","'Til it doesn't sting so much and until the blood's dried","And when somebody asks if I'm OK","I don't know what to say","And along the highway","From cast-off innumerable seeds","Wild sage growing in the weeds","Shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees","Sometime after midnight the ground is gonna freeze","Birds in the frosty air","What are they doing there?","Greenhouse full of butcher's-broom","Breeze is at my back","Sometime before the sun comes up","The earth is gonna crack","I look down at my hands","Like they were mirrors","Fresh coffee at sunrise","Warm my lips against the cup","Been waiting such a long time now","My number's finally coming up","All the neighbors come on out to their front porches","Waving torches","It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today","Spent half of the morning throwing old things away","Try not to get caught up, try to think like a machine","Focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means","Can't get you","Out of my head","Lost without you","Half dead","Took my spot at the window","Looked out at the road","Dots and dashes of traffic","Like a message in code","And whole boxes of memories","Wrapped up at the curb","I sang songs to myself that","Didn't have any words","Can't get you","Out of my head","Lost without you","Half dead","Stole out to the back yard late last night","Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight","Rising like giants from the cold earth","What are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?","Can't get you","Out of my head","Lost without you","Half dead","I will rise up early","And dress myself up nice","And I will leave the house","And check the deadlock twice","And I will find a crowd","And blend in for a minute","And I will try to find","A little comfort in it","And I will get lonely","And gasp for air","And send your name up from my lips","Like a signal flare","And I will go downtown","Stand in the shadows of the buildings","And button up my coat","Trying to stay strong, spirit willing","And I will come back home","Maybe call some friends","Maybe paint some pictures","It all depends","And I will get lonely","And gasp for air","And look up at the high windows","I see your face up there","A bad dream shook me in my sleep","And I woke up sweating","Ran through the dark to the shower","Already forgetting","Try to think good thoughts","Trying to find my way clear","Let the room fill with steam","Traced pictures on the mirror","Ghosts and clouds","And nameless things","Squint your eyes and hope real hard","Maybe sprout wings","I clawed my way to the living room window","Stood there in the cold","The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance","Hard to hold","I thought of old friends","The ones who'd gone missing","Said all their names three times","Phantoms in the early dark","Canaries in the mines","Ghosts and clouds","And nameless things","Squint your eyes and hope real hard","Maybe sprout wings","I went down to the gas station","For no particular reason","Heard the screams from the high school","It's football season","Empty lot the station faces","Will probably be there forever","I climbed over the four foot fence","I was trying to sever the tether","Moon in the sky","Cold as a stone","Spend each night in your arms","Always wake up alone","I lay down in the weeds","It was a real cold night","I was happy 'til the overnight attendant","Switched on the floodlight","Walking home I was talking to you under my breath","Saying things I would never say directly","I heard a siren on the highway up ahead","Kinda wished they'd come and get me","Frost on the sidewalk","White as a bone","Tried to get close to you again","Always wake up alone","And as I was crossing our doorstep","I hesitated just a moment there","Remembered the day we moved into our small house","'Til the vision got too vivid to bear","You were almost asleep","Halfway undressed","I lay right down next to you","Held your head against my chest","And a guy with any kind of courage","Would maybe stop to think the matter through","Maybe hold you still and raise the question","Instead of blindly holding onto you","But we crank up the heat","And you giggle and moan","Spend all night in the company of ghosts","Always wake up alone","Autumn came around like a drifter to an on-ramp","There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain","Took to walking barefoot around town","Melodies from grade school kicking in my brain","Saw you on the crosstown bus today","You were reading a magazine","I turned my face away","And I shut my eyes tight","Dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light","On dark hillsides in the hidden places","The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house","And I got off at the corner","Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands","And I wished I was someone else","And I wished it was warmer","And when I got home I thought about you","Like a desperate policeman searching for clues","And I almost passed out just then","And I shut my eyes again","Headed for the dark hillsides","In the hidden places","No one washed behind my ears","High in the trees alone for years","Practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons","Watching them go where they will go","Face in the leaves, song in my throat","Fall through the air, hoping to float","Practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy","Too heavy to carry","Watching them go where they will go","On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time","I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared","And I began to talk to myself almost immediately","Not being used to being the only person there","Mm-mm","The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much of it","But I drank it all just 'cause you hate it when I let things go to waste","And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost at the mall","And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space","And I sang","Oh, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?","What do I do without you?","On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time","I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat","And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened","I practically ran from the living room out into the street","And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend","And the world in its cold way started coming alive","And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train","And I got ready for the future to arrive","And I sang","Oh, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?","What do I do without you?","When the villagers come to my door","I will hide underneath the table in the dining room","Knees drawn up to my chest","When the villagers come to my door","I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach","Ah hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah","Waiting for the front door to splinter","Waiting all winter","When the villagers come to my door","I'll be all tucked away with my face to the floor","And my eyes closed","And no one knows how to keep secrets 'round here","They tell everyone everything soon as they know","And then where is there left for poor sinners to go?","Waiting for the front door to splinter","Waiting all winter","Sun just clearing the tree line when my day begins","Slippery ice on the bridges, north-eastern wind coming in","You will bruise my head, I will strike your heel","Drive past woods of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel","Dream at night, girl with the cobra tattoo","On her arm, its head flaring out like a parachute","Prisms in the dewdrops in the underbrush","Skate case sailors' purses floating down in the black needlerush 38","Higher than the stars I will set my throne","God does not need Abraham, God can raise children from stones","Dream at night, girl with the cobra tattoo","And try to hear the garbled transmissions come through","The day I turned my back on all you people","I felt an itching in my thumbs","Salt air like a broadcast from the distant dark beyond","When my transformation comes","I went down to the warm warm water","Saw a pelican fly past","Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me","I went wading through the grass","And no one was gonna come and get me","There wasn't anybody gonna know","Even though I leave a trail of burnt things in my wake","Every single place I go","And it was cool and it was quiet","In the humid marsh down there","I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water","Felt it gumming up my hair","The sun was sinking into the Atlantic","The last time that I turned my back on you","I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under","It was the best that I could do","And I said, let them all fare better than your servant","The reeds all pricking at my skin","Here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you","All that water rushing in","I am hiding in the house","Someone's coming through the gate","When the doorbell sounds like an air raid siren","I am lying in wait","People used to come around","They fish-eyed and they rubbernecked","Anyone who'd come to visit now","Is automatically a suspect","I creep up to the window","Me and my buzzing brain","And we watch two Jehovah's witnesses","Retreating down the lane","I'm not coming out yet","It's too cold","Leave me alone 'til I learn","How to spin straw into gold","I put on night vision goggles","Work my way along the wall into the kitchen","As soon as the first snow fell this year","My fingers started itching","And I locked up the doors","And I sealed up all the windows","And friends came by sometime for a while","I never let 'em in though","And then they stopped, then they stopped at last","And now it's just us three","These walls and the Church of Jesus Christ","Of the Latter-day Saints and me","And I'm not coming out yet","It's too cold","Leave me alone 'til I learn","How to spin straw into gold","You went away to Stockholm for a week","You came back with some scratch-marks on your cheeks","The towers line the highway and they cry","From deep down in their guts until they die","The water tower crew are total devils","Toxicity near saturation levels","I rise up and greet the day","See the serpents rising from the clay","You were headed down to Salzburg for the night","All my hair was turning white","You and your crew were good to go","So many people that we'll never really know","I saw the city men, they make me laugh","Digging up the cables, cutting them in half","I watch the ancient sun until it falls","See the serpents coming through the walls","You clean out your junk drawer","You mop up some blood, while the","First of some new creatures","Rises from the mud","Cursing the moment","That saw him draw breath","The ghost on your doorstep is starving","To death","You spray down the windows","You wipe them all clean, and you","Douse your old clothing","With fresh gasoline","And the ghost on your doorstep","Is soaked wet with rain","And he clutches his stomach","And howls at the pain","And you can stay busy all day","He's never going away","So let all the lights blaze","Keep your heart light","Play really loud music","All hours of the night","And when you set the table","Set it for two","The ghost on your doorstep has to eat","Same as you","Same as you","I checked into a bargain-priced room on La Cienega","Gazed out through the curtains at the parking lot","Walked down to the cornerstore just before nightfall in my bare feet","Black tarry asphalt, soft and hot","And when I came back, I spread out my supplies","On the counter by the sink, looked myself right in the eyes","St. Joseph's baby aspirin","Bartles & Jaymes","And you","Or your memory","I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise","Gathered in my loose ends, switched off the light","And down there in the dark I could see the real truth about me","As clear as day, Lord, if I make it through tonight","And I will mend my ways","And walk the straight path 'til the end of my days","St. Joseph's baby aspirin","Bartles & Jaymes","And you","Or your memory","'36 Hudson","In the garage","All sorts of junk","In the unattached spare room","Dishes in the kitchen sink","New straw for the old broom","Friends who don't have a clue","Well-meaning teachers","But down in your arms, in your arms","I am a wild creature","Floor two foot high with newspapers","White carpet thick with pet hair","Half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer","Fresh fuel for the sodium flares","I write down good reasons to freeze to death","In my spiral ring notebook","But in the long tresses of your hair","I am a babbling brook","I broke free on a Saturday morning","I put the pedal to the floor","Headed north on Mills Avenue 18","And listened to the engine roar","My broken house behind me and good things ahead","A girl named Kathy wants a little of my time","Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking","Ah-ha, listen to the engine whine","I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me","I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me","I played video games in a drunken haze","I was seventeen years young","Hurt my knuckles punching the machines","The taste of Scotch rich on my tongue","Then Kathy showed up and we hung out","Trading swigs from the bottle all bitter and clean","Locking eyes, holding hands","Twin high-maintenance machines","I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me","I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me","I drove home in the California dusk","I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum","Pictured the look on my stepfather's face","Ready for the bad things to come","I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway","The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear","The scene ends badly as you might imagine","In a cavalcade of anger and fear","There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year","I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me","I am gonna make it through this year if it kills me","The reception's gotten fuzzy","The delicate balance has shifted","Put on your gloves and your black pumps","Let's pretend the fog has lifted","Now you see me","Now you don't","Now you say you love me","Pretty soon you won't","If we get our full three score and ten","We won't pass this way again","So kiss me with your mouth open","Turn the tires toward the street","And stay sweet","All the chickens come on home to roost","Plump bodies blotting out the sky","You know it breaks my heart in half, in half","When I see them trying to fly","'Cause you just can't do","Things your body wasn't meant to","Hike up your fishnets","I know you","If we live to see the other side of this","I will remember your kiss","So do it with your mouth open","And take your foot off of the brake","For Christ's sake","All right, I'm on Johnson Avenue in San Luis Obispo","And I'm five years old or six maybe","And indications that there's something wrong with our new house","Trip down the wire twice daily","I'm in the living room watching the Watergate hearings","While my stepfather yells at my mother","Launches a glass across the room, straight at her head","And I dash upstairs to take cover","Lean in close to my little record player on the floor","So this is what the volume knob's for","I listen to dance music","Dance music","OK, so look, I'm seventeen years old","And you're the last, best thing I got going","But then the special secret sickness starts to eat through you","What am I supposed to do, no way of knowing","So I follow you down your twisting alleyways","Find a few cul-de-sacs of my own","There's only one place this road ever ends up","And I don't want to die alone","Let me down, let me down, let me down gently","When the police come to get me, I'm listening to dance music","Dance music","We stank of hair dye and ammonia","We sealed ourselves away from view","You were looking at the void and seldom blinking","The best that I could do","Was to train my eyes on you","We scaled the hidden hills beneath the surface","Scraped our fingers bloody on the stones","And built a little house that we could live in","Out of Dinu Lipatti's bones","We kept our friends at bay all summer long","Treated the days as if they'd kill us if they could","Ringing out the hours like blood-drenched bedsheets","To keep wintertime at bay","But December showed up anyway","There was no money, it was money that you wanted","I went downtown, sold off most of what I owned","And we raised a tower to broadcast all our dark dreams","From Dinu Lipatti's bones","There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet","No matter where you live","There'll always be a few things, maybe several things","That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive","There's gonna come a day when you feel better","You'll rise up free and easy on that day","And float from branch to branch, higher than the air","Just when that day is coming, who can say, who can say","Our mother has been absent","Ever since we founded Rome","But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home","We're gonna commandeer the local airwaves","To tell the neighbors what's been going on","And they will shake their heads, and wag their bony fingers","In all the wrong directions, and by daybreak we'll be gone","I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim","Scope out every angle of unfair advantage","I'm gonna bribe the officials, I'm gonna kill all the judges","It's gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage","Our mother has been absent","Ever since we founded Rome","But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home","The king of the jungle","Was asleep in his car","When your chances fall in your lap like that","You gotta recognize them for what they really are","Nobody in this house","Wants to own up to the truth","I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth","Grab hold of one long, sharp tooth","And hold on","For dear life","I hold on","Well, course he wakes up","His paw hits the horn","I am gonna regret","The day that I was born","And then Mom rushes out to the driveway","My sister too","Everyone screaming","I am dreaming of you","I hold on","For dear life","I hold on","And my arms get sore","And my palms start to sweat","And the tears roll down my face","'Til my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet","In come the cops","They blowtorch the doors","I start wailing","The lion roars","There's no good way to end this","Anyone can see","There's this great big you","And little old me","And we hold on","For dear life","We hold on","We hold on","You are sleeping off your demons","When I come home","Spittle bubbling on your lips","Fine white foam","I am young and I am good","It's a hot Southern California day","If I wake you up","There will be hell to pay","And alone in my room","I am the last of a lost civilization","And I vanish into the dark","And rise above my station","Rise above my station","But I do wake you up, and when I do","You blaze down the hall and you scream","I'm in my room with the headphones on","Deep in the dream chamber","And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face","Hoping you don't break my stereo","Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without","And so I think about that, and then I sort of black out","Held under these smothering waves","By your strong and thick-veined hand","But one of these days","I'm gonna wriggle up on dry land","Feed the kittens in the kitchen","Set food out for the strays","Try hard to do your best","The magpie will have his way","Fill your mouth with berries","By the full light of the moon","Work all night if you have to","The magpie comes at noon","Shore up the crucifixes","Above the archways and the doors","The magpie will come at midday","And you will go down on all fours","And when the cherries white with blossoms","Be ready and be brave","And remember what we had here","When there was something left to save","On the day that Dennis Brown's lung collapsed, spring rain was misting down on Kingston","And down at the harbor, local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment","And for a while there it was chaos","As they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors","On the day my lung collapses","It's not gonna be much different","On the day that Dennis Brown's habits caught up with him, schoolchildren sang in choirs","And out behind the Chinese restaurants, guys were jumping into dumpsters","And the stench was overbearing","But they were past the point of caring","On the day my habits catch up with me","I'll be down among the jumpers","And when the birds come home in spring, we will fill them full of buckshot","And jets of contaminated blood will cloud the rivers and the lakes","It took all the coke in town","To bring down Dennis Brown","On the day my lung collapses","We'll see just how much it takes","King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong","And Joseph's brother sold him down the river for a song","And Sonny Liston rubbed some Tiger Balm into his glove","Some things you do for money, and some you do for love, love, love","Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why","When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye","Some things you'll do for money, and some you'll do for fun","But the things you do for love are gonna come back to you one by one","Love, love is gonna lead you by the hand","Into a white and soundless place","Now we see things as in a mirror dimly","Then we shall see each other face to face","And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain","Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain","Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above","Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love, love, love","Got up before dawn","Went down to the racetrack","Riding with the windows down","Shortly after your first heart attack","You parked behind the paddock","Cracking asphalt underfoot","Coming up through the cracks","Pale green things","Pale green things","We watched the horses run their workouts","You held your stopwatch in your left hand","And a racing form beneath your arm","Casting your gaze way out to no man's land","Sometimes I'll meet you out there","Lonely and frightened","Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves","Pale green things","Pale green things","My sister called at 3 AM","Just last December","She told me how you died at last, at last","And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered","I turned it over in my mind","Like a living Chinese finger trap","Seaweed and Indiana sawgrass","Pale green things","Pale green things","Breaking the signal 'til it's totally unreadable","Drinking the dregs, eating the utterly inedible","We do what we do, all for you","All dressed up, black hat and white cane","Slowing circling the drain","Ready for the future","Ready for the world about to come","Shooting the sequel before the treatment's even finished","Sanding numbers off the Monojects as our slight returns diminish","We are what we are, get in the goddamn car","Smiling faces, flawlessly rehearsed","We are sleek and beautiful, we are cursed","Ready for the future","Ready for the world about to come","Ah","Holt Boulevard","Between Garey and White","Hooked up with some friends at the Travelodge","Set ourselves up for the night","Carpenter ants in the dresser","Flies in the screen","It will be too late by the time we learn","What these cryptic symbols mean","And I dreamt","Of a house","Haunted by all you tweakers with your hands out","And the headstones climbed up the hills","And the headstones climbed up the hills","Send somebody out for soda","Comb through the carpet for clues","Reflective tape on our sweatpants","Big holes in our shoes","Every couple minutes","Someone says he can't stand it anymore","Laugh lines on our faces","Scale maps of the ocean floor","And I dreamt","Of a camera","Pointing out from inside the television","And the aperture yawning and blinking","And the headstones climbed up the hills","And the headstones climbed up the hills","If anybody comes to see me","Tell 'em they just missed me by a minute","If anybody comes into our room while we're asleep","I hope they incinerate everybody in it","And I dreamt","Of a factory","Where they manufactured what I needed","Using shiny new machines","And the headstones climbed up the hills","And the headstones climbed up the hills","Gentle hum of the old machines","Here we come, scrubbed and scoured","Patches on our jeans","When the drone sounds in the cool night wind","We pick up the call","Kick all the traces in","Hungry for love","Ready to drown","So tie down the sails","We're going downtown","Great big drain on the power grid","You may not like Tate's methods","But you've got to admit, she's a real nice kid","We walk light down the wires","Higher than weather balloons","Empty hearts on fire","Hungry for love","Ready to drown","So tie down the sails tonight","We're going downtown","Martin calls to say he's sending old electrical equipment","That's good, we can always use some more electrical equipment","In the cold, clear light of day down here, everyone's a monster","That's cool with all of us, we've been past the point of help since early April","Susan and her notebook","Freehand drawings of Lon Chaney","Blueprints for geodesic domes","Recipes for cake","Yeah, we're all here","Chewing our tongues off","Waiting for the fever to break","When we walk out in the sunlight we tell everyone we know it hurts our eyes","When the real reason we don't like it is that it makes us wonder if we're dying","And Martin's found an old trunk full of stage makeup in the basement","And he's sending it along, we can always use more makeup, yeah","Yeah, more creams","And powders","And Carrie's got the feeling","That the people next door","Will close in like a wolfpack","Should we make one small mistake","Yeah, we're all here","Chewing our tongues off","Waiting for the fever to break","Boats ease into the harbor bearing real suspicious cargo","And the sunlight on the water sets a switch off in your brain","The things that you've got coming will consume you","There's someone waiting out there in an alley with a chain","Here they come","The young thousands","Here they come","The young thousands","The ghosts that haunt your building are prepared to take on substance","And the dull pain that you live with isn't getting any duller","There's a closet full of almost pristine videotape","Documenting sordid little scenes in living color","Here they come","The young thousands","Here they come","The young thousands","You drive east from the ocean with both hands tied on the wheel","And you go past Garden Grove as the pleasure index rises","The things that you've got coming will do things that you're afraid to","There is someone waiting out there with a mouthful of surprises","The ghosts that haunt your building have been learning how to breathe","They scan the hallways nightly vainly searching for a sign","There must be diamonds somewhere in a place that stinks this bad","There are brighter things than diamonds coming down the line","Here they come","The young thousands","Here they come","The young thousands","The men were here to get your Belgian things","They'll store them for you in an airplane hangar","There's guys in biohazard suits, mud caking on their rubber

standards of any kind to break, no creeds to disavow","I am right here where you want me","Do what you brought me out here for","You can arm me to the teeth","You can't make me go to war","The last white slabs of snow","Melted off seven weeks ago","And the geese are headed north again","Through the tightening sky, and I","Can feel my heart in my throat again","New onions growing in the ground","The cows come gingerly out of the barn","When they see that the ground is warm","They pick up a little speed, it makes me feel so good","And I feel it rushing down my throat, fresh blood","I head out onto the earth, its cold heart is melting","I don't know if I can stand it","Springtime's coming, that means you'll be coming back around","New onions growing underground, underground","Bluejays and Cardinals all come out to play","The highway traffic gets out of your way","Skies clear up if they're overcast","Pit bulls are gentle when you come past","Stars come out of

drive myself insane","All I have to do is watch you breathing","And at 5 AM","I turned the radio on","And an old man's voice","Sang a short, sweet song","And then the static roared again","Hungry for blood","I heard the rain falling from the rainspout","Down, down into the sweet, wet mud","And you punched out all the windows","And the wind began to wail","And you gathered your hair behind your head","Like God was gonna catch you by the ponytail","And then the old voice crackled through the static","And I felt young and alive","And the hairs stood up on the back of my neck","We were rising from the grave","Yeah, yeah","Bag full of oily rags","Fifty cent lighter","Dreams of retirement in Cancún","Burning ever brighter","There's a lot of ways to make money in this world","But I can't

soon","And I know I can't afford another night here in this place","With its sixteenth floor view of the ocean and the dunes","And it's gonna be just you and me today","Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay","I can hear the roar of the crowd","In the stadium a couple blocks away","It's the kind of thing that used to get me all worked up","But I don't want to talk about it now, OK,

anyway","And we stare into the sun all day","And you're about to leave again, I've learned to read your movements","And I'm learning how to read your mind","The sun climbs the sky for us above the Mississippi","And I feel you in my arms but you're hardly even with me","This morning I know who you are","This morning I know who you are","You came down from heaven to the branch outside my window","Your feathers were the color of snow","The dice were loaded against us ever seeing each other","But one of us had nowhere else to go","In your eyes were all the colors that the rainbow forgot","Your wingspan was three feet wide or better","With your voice practicing notes from time's own beginning","You took apart the alphabet letter by letter","And here","Where it all stops for good","Where the cool waters run","Thought I saw a mouse kicking in your beak","It was only a skeleton","Sure as a surgeon","You slipped your hand into the doorjam","Blood coursing through the air tonight","I know who I am","And I know who you are","Or who you were just an hour ago","Static interference on the radio tonight","I know what I know","Quick as lightning","You brought your hand back inside","And you shut the door behind you","It's too hot out there tonight","Breath rising and falling","Expansion, contraction","Why'd you tell me this","Were you looking for my reaction","Most of the brine has got to boil away","Most of the air has got to choke it","Most of June I spent in jail again","I don't mean jail exactly","Up in the pine tree","Red squirrel looking down at me","I am losing control of the language again","I am losing control of the language again","Most of the things I used to hold on to","Most of the things I used to say to you","Most of the ways I knew around the local roads","Are disappearing daily","High in the cottonwood","You were looking down at me and you sure looked good","Hair hanging down in the leaves","Neck tilted back to make a rainbow","I was losing control of the language again","I was losing control of the language again","Wax paper that I taped over the windows","Melted quick as chocolate in the heat","It'll probably never come off now","The windows look like frosted glass if you see them from the street","And the dim light that filters through","Cast a new light on you","It makes me get all misty because I remember something","And then I see your shadow","And I","I want to follow you all the way down this time","I want to see what it is you're going down for","I, I want you more than I want anything","I want you the way you were","You were lying in the moonlight","Outside in the grass","When I heard an animal voice somewhere in the dark","And I saw a wing shadow pass","And just then the gleam in your eye","Made my blood freeze","There was something up above us","Rustling in the branches of the trees","And I","I pressed up against you again","I could hear your heartbeat steady and hard and pure","I used to love you so much that I was sure it would kill me","And I want you the way you were","I know what my weaknesses are","Probably better than you do","Revolutionary Chinese propaganda","The color of blue","I thought I knew what my weaknesses were anyway","And then the orange tree blossomed last Saturday","There was nothing in it but pain for me","I know what can hurt me real bad","And what can't hurt me anymore","I know how to rise up with the sun","And I am learning what sleep's good for","I thought I'd figured out the world and its circular way","And then I saw the sun fall down out

Johnson is my name","Brooklyn is my station","Heaven is my resting place","God is my salvation","You turned to me and asked me if I'd always be your boy","As we drove across the river into western Illinois","And on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel","Wheels were spinning out sparks, scraping at the rails","Wind in your hair all right","Sunset spilling through the rear window","Your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders, beaded with sweat","On the day that I become so forgetful","That all of this melts away","I will burn all the calendars that counted the years down to","Such a worthless day","As we walked across the parking lot toward the motel office","We were walking with a benediction on us","Light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky","Like a monument to desperation two floors high","Mile and a half from the river","We went back to the car to get our overnight bags","Sunset spilling through your earrings all over your body","When we shut the motel room door behind us","We knew we'd hit the mother lode","On the day that I forget you","I hope my heart explodes","The land's opening up like a blanket","And the dandelions spread themselves thickly out","Along the fields which are evidently endless","And we are hotly in love with one another","We've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats","We are for some reason all the time bleeding","And we are friendless","And we love these dogs","That roll on the lawns here in Galesburg","Because they seem to know something nobody else knows","It is written in the smiles on their faces","And it rings in their high, young voices","We are burning up all of our choices up here where the tall grass grows","Up here in Galesburg","The sky's opening up like an old wound","And the rain on our bodies is warm tonight","And the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder","We can taste fresh blood in our mouths again","There is no chance of getting enough of it","And we tally up all up all our possessions","We're going under","Yeah, we love these dogs","That lull in the rain here in Galesburg","As the new season rocks them in its terrible arms","Yeah, they howl as though the world were ending","As we are watching the sky unwinding","And some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form","Up here in Galesburg","Up here in Galesburg","Way up north","Down the road a little","Back in New England","Right here in the middle","And all the way out west","We had our ears to the ground","All of our dreams resting in the same spot","Listening for the old sound","And it was ringing as clear as crystal","And it was shining as bright as gold","Grain gathering on the stone floor","And we were spring-heeled and we were real cold","All summer long","Deep into autumn","In a high room","And down here in the bottom","Down here in the bottom","Sun twinkling on the river this eve","I tasted chocolate on my tongue","Darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky","Rung by agonizing rung","I heard firecrackers popping next door","Wondered what it was I'd bargained for","When I laid quiet on the floor","And you were knocking","Let me be your witness","Let me walk out on the edge","Sun refused to shine on my backyard today","Darkness climbing up the house coming through the window ledge","I saw the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk","Heard you talking your baby talk","Saw the bright lights again and I felt the shock","When you were knocking","Lying in the hot sun today","Watching the clouds run away","Thought a little while about you","The sky was a petrifying blue","And while the geese flew past for no reason at all","I let the sky fall","This is an empty country and I am the king","And I should not be allowed to touch anything","I picked myself up off the ground","Shook the grass from my hair and I walked around","Felt the warm sun in my eye","Strangers were passing by","I shinnied up the black walnut tree","Let the hard blue sky fall right through me","And I saw the sad young cardinals trying to sing","And I should not be allowed to touch anything","When you were nineteen I first laid eyes on you","The small stream that ran through the center of town carried your name to me","Your hair was dark and your eyes were a frosty blue","And then they put me in jail 'til you were 23","When you were 24 we took to drinking and dancing","We boxed with our shadows like a couple of kangaroos","And then we went down to Chechnya for the weekend","Your eyes were glacial and your promises all rang true","And things are happening here while we sleep","I can feel it in my boiling brain","And I'm dreaming in blood-red color","When I see the Stolypin car riding through the light rain","They'll have to carry me out on my back","They'll have to tear me to pieces all right","We are warm in our hidden room down here","We've got stars in our eyes tonight","Seeds came in the mail today from Holland","And the language on the package is wonderful and strange","All sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth","In goodly colors gloriously arranged","I circled the house and I scattered them around","Let the water sink down into the soil","Stared a long time at the residue","Blood, milk, and oil","God, the humidity is something","Our shirts are soaked clean through","But the house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming","And I keep looking at you","And then you're singing in Dutch to me","And I recognize the song","And it seems so old and so fragile","And I haven't heard it in so long","We may throw the windows open later","But we are not as far west as you suppose we are","Hot wind coming off the water","Sky gone crazy with stars","While we stay here, we imagine we're alive","We see shadows on the walls","There's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air","Sweat, water, and alcohol","Just the old blood","Rising up through the wooden floor again","Just the old love","Asking for more again","Rain all burned away","The horseflies are an iridescent green","Plums boiled down to pulp","Drying on a screen","Bright red air inside the house here","I can barely draw breath","Dark blue shapes pop behind my eyelids","I am not afraid of death","And on the television","Black and white footage of the young Cassius Clay","My God, my God, my God","He was something","Fists flashing as he comes toward the screen","Sailing headlong into nothing","And disappearing","Reappearing","Out there in the clearing","Floating down a slight breeze","That plays along the edges of the leaves","It's you","It's you","It's you","Meanwhile out where nothing starts","Out where the railyard ends","The sun up above us is trying to kill himself","We were watching the skies again","Why do we come down to Brownsville","Year after year after year","This was the question we never even posed","Ringing like a siren in our ears","Down on the Mexican border","In the unfathomable heat","With our shirts tied around our waists","And the world at our feet","We looked at one another's bodies","Figured we looked all right","Ready to die if we had to","Watching the skies all night","And I was sure my heart would break","When the sun sank down into California","I felt your breath on my neck, it was hot and good and pure","And I wanted to warn you","It's all coming apart again","It's all coming apart again","It's all coming apart again","It's all coming apart again","Down in the South Bronx","Down home","Saw you walking down the street again","Saw you looking sweet again","I saw you coming through","I turned my head away from you","Why do you come here","Why do you come around","Why'd you go home","Why'd you head on home to Rockaway?","When the seashells crumbled in your hand","You looked up at me","And the sands shifting underneath your feet","Softened for you and incredibly","The sun went through from the sky","And I was certain I was going to cry","But then you reached up and you reached out","We'd been staring at the water all day","And then you touched me, you were golden","You were giving the game away","When the sand crabs ran across your face","You didn't even twitch","And a salt scent came across the water","Impossibly rich","Impossibly cold","We were just nineteen years old","But then you reached up","And you reached out","We'd been staring at the water all day","And then you touched, me you were golden","You were giving the game away","Gotta keep moving","Gotta keep moving","Blues falling down like hail","Gotta keep moving","Blues falling down like hail","And the daylight keeps moving","There's a hellhound on my trail","If today was Christmas Eve, and tomorrow were Christmas Day","If today was Christmas Eve, and tomorrow were Christmas Day","And tomorrow were Christmas Day All I would need is my little sweet rider","And the world would fade away","Gotta keep moving","Gotta keep moving","Blues falling down like hail","Gotta keep moving","Blues falling down like hail","And the daylight keeps to worrying me","There's a hellhound on my trail, yeah","When you saw the evening star","Shining in the freezing sky","I saw something dark and silent","Passing by","Full moon","Deep grass","Cold water","When you said your name out loud","Something broke inside me","Nothing new to take a hold of","No new world to hide me","Full moon","Deep grass","Cold water","Full moon","Deep grass","Cold water","Your house is depressing","Your house is dirty","Why don't you come outside a little while?","Why don't you step out into the sun?","Let me take you down","Let me ease you around Montgomery","And out there on the front porch","Your hair shines in the sun","And I can see the sun gathering on your eyes","What the hell are you looking at?","Let me take you down","Let me ease you around Montgomery","Deep is the midnight sea","Warm is the fragrant night","Sweet are your lips to me","Soft as the moon and sand","Oh, when shall we meet again","When the night has left us","Will the spell remain","The waves invade the shore","Though we may kiss no more","Night is at our command","Moon and sand","The waves invade the shore","And though we may kiss no more","Night is at our command","Moon and sand","The wind blew in across the water","And the wind blew through your hair","And I walked around the lake's perimeter","And then I saw you there","I will grab you by the ears","I will grab you by the ears","I will grab you by the ears","And you will know something","You will know something","I saw the birds fly out across the lake","I saw the birds go by","And I walked around the lake's perimeter","And I saw the lake reflected in your eyes","I will grab you by the ears","I will grab you by the ears","I will grab you by the ears","And you will know something","You will know something","I saw you in the blazing light","When the lotus caught fire","In the middle of the night","It froze me","It froze me","I saw you coming closer real slow","You grabbed hold","I let go","Yeah I saw you in the blazing light","I saw you","I saw you all right","It froze me","It froze me","It froze me","It froze me","I saw the ceiling spin","And I saw the room shift","And I watched the television flicker","And I let my mind drift","I would give anything in the world up for you","But I will not stop","I saw the blossom form","And I saw the screen glow","And I let my arm fall to my side","And I took one step back","And I would give anything in the world up for you","But I will not stop","When I came back from Finland","The taxi took me down the street","I saw the red flowers growing like they used to","By the roadside in the smothering summer heat","You were standing out in front of the house","With your floral print dress on","And you had questions only a masochist would ask","Written all over your big brown eyes","And the moon is high over Iowa at night","And the moon is high over Iowa at night","And I brought you a blanket","Hand woven, hand dyed","The moon is high over Iowa at night","I know what I want","And I know what we need","When the first fruits of the harvest","Begin to blacken and bleed","And the purple fruit gives way when you press it","Even so slightly","And through the thatches behind the green leaves","We heard the fire-eyed macaw sing as evil as you please","And his little song","Is a very pretty song","But it's something I won't stand for","And as the sun rises over Columbia","I know we're done for","When the holes started forming in the tent","And you wondered out loud where the sunlight went","I had a mind to tell you","But I didn't want to hurt you","And if I knew how to form the words","I would ask you what you'd come for","But as the sun rises over Columbia","I know we're done for","Yeah, as the sun rises over Columbia","I know we're done for","As the sun rises over Columbia","I know we're done for","When I saw it on the bakery carousel","I knew I had to have it for my own","I eased it out","And I brought it home","Why don't you try some","I already had some myself","Is that the most delicious thing","You ever tasted in your life","Is that the most delicious thing","You ever tasted in your life","And then the cold sorrow gripped me by the throat","And then I felt the colder sadness taking hold","I knew I had to have it for my own","Why don't you try some","Why don't you try some","Is that the most delicious thing","You ever tasted in your life","Is that the most delicious thing","You ever tasted in your life","And then I saw the snow against the window","And then I saw the snow hit the window","And then I saw the snow brush against the window","And then I saw the snow in here","Listen, you can tell your lawyer","That he can go to hell","'Cause I can take whatever you are offering up","Reasonably well","And if four long years come to nothing","That's all right","But it's your birthday","It's your birthday tonight","And I went to buy you something","But I caught myself in time","And nothing makes any sense anymore","But everything rhymes","Die hard","Die kicking","Old habit of mine","Die hard","Die kicking","Old habit of mine","Die hard","Die hard","Die kicking","I've been drinking that coffee you sent me from Thailand","I've been watching the lamps burn","I've been listening to the wind chime","I've been waiting my turn","And I'm coming to you","I am coming to you","I am coming to you","And I heated the milk until it boiled and I drank it down","And I stepped outside and I checked my reflection in the rain","There were voices on the wind","Winter coming on in","And I made myself up again, brand new","And I am broken and I am tired","And I'm coming to you with my mouth","Dripping","We heard the rats in the rafters scurry by","And we wondered about the color of the sky outside","In Warsaw in 1939","It was all right just to be alive","It was good that you were mine","And you held your hands up","To form a heart in the air","You held your hands up with your thumbs touching","They formed a heart in the air","Through the piece missing from the brick wall","We had an excellent view of the soldiers coming down the hall","And you held your hands up where I could see them in the dark","They formed a heart in the air","You held your hands up","And they formed a heart in the air","I heard the old songs radiating from you","I heard the old songs radiating from you","There was a barn owl trapped in the rafters","The ground underneath us was wet and cold","We heard the owl thrashing about","Trying desperately to get out","We stood outside and watched the night unfold","We watched the sun go down on Scotland","And I watched the moon come up over you","When a pack of dogs went silently past us","We knew we'd been given fair warning","But that was the only thing we knew","And you threw all your luggage out onto the water","And I tore the shirt away from my back","The cold came on with a new found intensity","And you pressed your warm body against me","And I loved you so much it was making me sick","And we watched the sun go down on Scotland","We were glad that we'd left Oklahoma behind","I took your hips in my hands and I threw you down","To the new found rich brown deep wet ground","Had a vision of you burning on my mind","We watched the sun go down on Scotland","And I watched the moon come up over you","When a pack of dogs went silently past us","We knew we'd been given fair warning","But that was the only thing we knew","We broke the doorknob off of the door","The door swung open easily","You sauntered into the poorly lit store","And looked around lazily","We stole every bit of candy they had inside","Gobbled it all up greedily on our three-month ride","I'm gonna miss you when you're gone","I'm gonna miss you when you're gone","We headed out to the getaway car","And hit the open road","I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face","But I could not break the code","We had hot caramels sticking to our teeth","And the only love I've ever know burning underneath","I'm gonna miss you when you're gone","I'm gonna miss you when you're gone","I'm gonna miss you when you're gone","I'm gonna miss you when you're gone","There was a new song on the air","I saw you coming across the square","And a white bird broke the dark Korean sky","As the rest of my life went by","You had your warm hand on my face","I took your index finger in between my teeth","And I held it gently in place","It was resting lightly on my tongue in there","I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air","There but for the grace of the lord of song","I would be this very second and I'm coming right along","You had your cardigan on","I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone","I remember your eyelids","I remember your body now","Well, you were standing in the door","Well, I wondered what you were waiting for","I saw the wild strawberries on the vine","Out of control","Well I was trying to think of something clever","You were saying nothing whatsoever","I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil","Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil","We'd come from California","The air around you was familiar to me now","If you were gazing westward","I was looking at you again","All I know","Is I'm in love you","Even though","You say that we are through","I know without your love","I just can't go on","I wonder where our love has gone","Always thought","You'd love me more and more","Never dreamed","You'd ever let me go","I know without your love","I just can't go on","I wonder where our love has gone","Now, what did I do","And what did I say","That ever could leave you","To treat me this way","If I've been untrue","I'm willing to pay","And darling, if that's not enough I'll do anything you say","So darling, please","Wherever you may be","Hear my plea","And hurry home to me","I know without your love","I just can't go on","I wonder where our love has gone","One day in September","You come here","You pull my head down","And you whisper in my ear","And you tell me the sidewalk","Is as far as the world really goes","But that's a secret","Everybody knows","You hold my head in your hands","You say my name","How is it that though you say it some twenty-thousand times","It's never quite the same","And you tell me that Hercules","Died burned consumed by an article of his own clothing","That's something","I'd rather not be reminded of","The last of the repercussions","Died off real slow","The sky was still","And the cold sun sank down beneath the snow","I hung by my hand","From the tree outside","And I looked on the whole wide world","The voices came quietly","I shut them down","A tricky young southernly wind","Came at me with its high whistling sound","I turned around to face it","With real arrogance burning inside","And I drank in the whole wide world","I am wearing","A white long-sleeve button-down","The pink colors behind the clouds tonight","Mirror the softer shades of your nightgown","As the neurotransmitters go crazy inside of me","You swear you're leaving town","Empty promises","Empty promises","I am watching","The way the wind seems to pass straight through your body","When you run your fingernail along my neck","And you spill some water on me","You say you're as good as gone","Well, don't look now, but here comes the dawn","Empty promises","Empty promises","Empty promises","Empty promises","I cut down that withered peach tree","Just like you asked me to","And I hacked it into pieces","Set it on fire with your face in plain view","At the near window where you stood","Watching me split the wood","I will do as I am told","I will keep away the cold","The fire pit in the snow","Gave off a rich bright orange-red glow","And a familiar scent rose up into the air","And I remembered something special from a long time ago","You opened up the door","Stepped away from the killing floor","Your footprint on the snow was fresh and new","When you touched me I felt fire coming through","I will do as I am told","I will keep away the cold","I will do as I am told","I will keep away the cold","The ghostly sing-song","Of the children playing double Dutch","I felt the wind come through the window","I felt it turn around and switch back","In the second-story room","In Jamaica, Queens","Your hair was dripping wet","Your skin was clean","And the children skipping rope","Tripled their speed","You were all I'd ever wanted","You were all I'd ever need","In New York City in the middle of July","The air was heavy and wet","The air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine","I will know who you are yet, I will know who you are yet","We were real hungry and half dead","When you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread","And in the tropical air the scent rose like a spirit","Moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited","Ah","We were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm","I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm","You pressed your soft cheek up against my gut","Pure gold, nothing but gold","And I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie","'Cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you","I cut myself a two foot switch","From some tropical hardwood nearby","And the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously","Through the air from a thousand miles away","The monkeys jumped from tree to tree","It sent a deathly chill through me","In Bolivia","Wildcats I had never seen","Claimed places in my room","And animal noises rang through the thick brush","Like voices from the tomb","I saw the freshly-polished chrome","Gleaming in the midday sun","And I knew that you were coming home","To Bolivia","Hey, hey","I was sitting at the edge of the marsh","When the council came to bring me the news","They handed me a bowl of cooked wild grasses and they","Gave me the

broken","And I see you standing there in the doorway soaking","The water drizzles off of you down to the floor","And I say that I don't want to live in New England anymore","Some flower petals stick to your skin","I grab hold of your hip and I pull you in","When the building establishes control","When the thunder from the north begins to roll","Down our way, I know I've been right all along","And you start singing that stupid children's song","You think I don't know it, but I just don't feel like singing it","I sure do love you","I sure do love you","When I see you in your new blue jeans","I know you're lying","And I know what it means","When I see you take your place among the poor","I know you're a fraud for sure","Bad priestess","Bad priestess","So the sunlight plays its games along your eyes","And it has the same effect on a thousand other guys","And I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the pull too","But the sunlight makes me strong and I know about you","Bad priestess","Bad priestess","On a Thursday as the sun goes does","Bad priestess","With a super-special eyelash trick","Bad priestess","Bad priestess","I looked you up and down","I liked everything I saw","From the fragile outline of your hips","To the trembling movements in your jaw","But then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor","You said that you couldn't take it anymore","I knew you were leaving","I knew you were going to Bristol","I watched you pack your bags","Saw you head up to the door","But when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock","You said that you couldn't take it anymore","That was the second time you said that in one day","Why don't you just sit still, it's going to be OK","Going to Bristol","Going to Bristol","Going to Bristol","Going to Bristol","When I was twelve years old","They put me on the throne","When I was twelve years old","They made me king","From the ocean south of here to the northern hemisphere","They made me everything","Now I'm thirteen","And no one takes me seriously","Now I'm thirteen","And they're trying to take away control","I don't know how stupid","You all think I am","But as sure as flowers grow along the western wall","Heads are gonna roll","Yeah","I saw your arms hanging at your side","Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide","Saw you moving, real slow","Nowhere to run to, nowhere to go","I heard the wind blow","I saw your sash come untied","Blue water, white sky","Up in the cedars we were too far away","For the radio to tell us the time of day","But there was moisture in the air","And I heard the city call","They could go on burning","To hell with them all","Your liquid movements","The water rushing by","Blue water, white sky","World's surface was as smooth as glass","They saw the hour coming and they didn't let it pass","I heard you say my name twice through your teeth","I saw you coming down to me, I was underneath you","It's been coming for some time","You close your eyes","Blue water, white sky","I heard the wind blow","I saw your sash come untied","Blue water, white sky","The cave mouth shines","By pure force of will","I look down on the world","From the top of this lonesome hill","And you can run","And run some more","From here all the way to Singapore","But I will carry you home in my teeth","In the great hall you drink red wine","You chew meat off the bone","I beat down a new path to the castle","I come naked and alone","I laid my son on the bier, I burned the wreath","Fire overhead, water underneath","And you can stand up, or you can run","You and I both know what you've done","And I will carry you home","I will carry you home","I will carry you home in my teeth","Doll Squad's at the drive-in","It's 1973","And the fruit is full and fat this year on the orange trees","Which grow in clusters","The city's 60 miles away","As the sunset tries desperately","To break through the gray","And the stardust","Came down","Royal blue","As the San Bernardino sky","Showered over you","Coming home early","Is always a mistake","But when see that woman on the sofa","Something in you breaks","You got a celluloid tendency to flare out and blaze","And the report sounds once like a failed hymn of praise","And the stardust","Came down","Royal blue","As the San Bernardino sky","Showered over you","My hand brushes against the lock of hair that hangs down past your ear to your jaw","My hand brushes against the lock of hair that hangs down past your ear to your jaw","It's real neat","The moment's sweet but it's all wrong","And we're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside","We're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside","Yeah, I'm the model of composure out there","But you oughta see me shaking later on","My brain gets flooded six hours later","My brain gets flooded over six hours later","And rivers run with pictures of you as I stare up at the blood-red moon","Lying out front on the lawn","Hey","The most remarkable thing about coming home to you","Is the feeling of being in motion again","It's the most extraordinary thing in the world","I have two big hands and a heart pumping blood","And a 1967 Colt .45 with a busted safety catch","The world shines","As I cross the Macon county line","Going to Georgia","The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you","And that you're standing in the doorway","And you smile as you ease the gun from my hands and I'm","Frozen with joy right where I stand","The world throws its light underneath your hair","Forty miles from Atlanta this is nowhere","Going to Georgia","The world shines","As I cross the Macon county line","Going to Georgia","It's a cold night in Sonora","And the stars are out in full force","It's a moment the world has been waiting for","When you set the world back on course","Into the fire you go","Into the fire you go","It's a strange gathering around you","And the Lord of the Snails is born","Five minutes before you take on divinity","You hear the crackling, well, you hear the snapping corn","Into the fire you go","Into the fire you go","Into the fire you go","Into the fire you go","The rain didn't come","For one calendar year","So when the man with the sunflower seeds in his hand","Came here","We sent him away","We sent him away","The rain didn't come","For twelve months more","So when the man with the seed catalogs darkened our door","We sent him away","We sent him away","We sent him away","We sent him away","And I know you're waiting","For the ironic ending","And I know you're waiting","For the punchline","And I know you're waiting","For the rain to come by","So am I","So am I","So am I","So am I","He came spitting fire","On a day like no other","Tried to hold you near to me","I heard him passing over","He made a banquet for the stray dogs of the air","He put our love in clear perspective","Blue, red, and green plumage","Trailing behind him now","Swaddling the sky in its aftermath","The last day coming down","He made a banquet for the stray dogs of the air","He put our love in clear perspective","Rising, rising, rising, rising","You've come back from Yosemite","You

dead","Killed by the saviors of his dreams","How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation","How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation","Lay out on the patio","Dreaming","Lay out on the patio","Dreaming","And the Chinese rifles sounded in the evening air","I heard them popping off everywhere","I lay out on the patio","On the chaise lounge","I lay out on the patio","Where I let my hand rest against the hot redwood frame","And the Chinese rifles sounded again","I could not stomach their acumen","Felt sick, felt good","The heat burns with the old wood","Muscles in my arms pump like machines","The Jericho palm tree is plush and green","Bright sun, the new day","I felt sick in a good way","Felt the fever climb when you came down","All the way across town","And you brought me","A plate of sweet potatoes","Sun fading overhead","The sunset bright red","Your green eyes, your smooth walk","Fresh tomato, celery stalk","You cook Pari basmati rice","I felt good, you looked nice","You stood like Galatea over me","You brought fried garlic and kimchi","And you brought me","A plate of sweet potatoes","They wanted me to be a lawyer","They wanted me to work in a machine shop","They wanted me to be a designer","But I came out on top","I'm a fireman","I'm a fireman","Stand and watch the smoke","See the flames rise to the sky","I stand and watch the flames climb higher","I feel the smoke get in my eyes","I'm a fireman","I'm a fireman","I went down to Lloyd Center","Looking for you","But a mouth full of anger","Blocked my view","He took your hand","There in the skating ring","God will give him blood to drink","Saw the two of you leaving","I didn't want to follow behind","But I could see the rest of your evening","Burning in my mind","Sky's black","The moon's pink","God will give him blood to drink","I looked over the railing","Ice was white","On the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend","On a Friday night","I went mining for gold","I struck pure, fresh zinc","God, God will give him blood to drink","Hey hey hey","And the May sun shone down on California","And the strawberries grew fat and full","And thick and red and as big as your fist","And the traffic on Riverside Drive was thin","But by no means nonexistent","When I saw you","Against the soda machine","I saw you leaning there","And your hand in the basket","Was nimble-fingered and red-fingernailed","And it made me remember the sunflower","That popped up outside my window one morning in Norwalk","It was bright yellow and it was real inviting","And I almost forgot that it was an intruder","And I saw you","Against the soda machine","I saw you leaning there","I saw you","Against the soda machine","I saw you leaning there","You know","You know","You

last of the bright birds coming home","I saw you address them through your megaphone","And you asked me when we were leaving","Well, it's any day now","And what flowers there were around

cold and poised and threatening","Heard your voice come lilting through the wall","I heard your voice come sailing from the other room","Let the young lions come","Let me break their jaws","Let the young lions come out","Let me break their jaws","With my bare fingers","Coffee was dripping through the paper filter cone","The heady scent of it nearly knocked me out","I heard your voice come

about power","In its purest form","If I had a car and you were riding in it","I'd show you what my car could do","I'd head east out Highway 15","And see the starlight shower over you","Gas fumes rising from the blacktop","Cheap motels with flashing signs","Just an old sweet song made new","And oozing through the pines","If I had thirty dollars and I could make time stop","And the moon was high up above","And moonbeams fell like sweet cream","Then the night air would carry our dark dreams","Gas fumes rising off the highway","Neon flashing everywhere","Just an old sweet song made new by your body","And desert flowers blooming in the thick night air","The young sun","The old story forming","Hasn't been the same","Since dad came by this morning","Did you see the way mom's looking at us","Mark it well","Your eyes meet mine","When we hear her call","The strange birds in the yard","Are perched above the symbols that she painted on the garden wall","Did you see the way mom's looking at us","Did you see the way mom's looking at us","Don't say anything","We both know you're leaving","You just don't want to say it yet","'Cause you don't want to hurt my feelings, so you","Gnaw your little holes in the net","And you torture me","With those big eyes","And you punish me","With pity","But I'm going to Cleveland","You say you wanted to strike first","Because one of us was leaving, that's what you say","But I've always been real fond of you","So I never would have treated you this way","And you torture me","With those big eyes","And you punish me","With pity","But I'm going to Cleveland","I hear the Cuyahoga calling, now I know","What I was born for","And you say, Hey, John, where are you going","But that's not my name anymore","And you torture me","With those big eyes","And you punish me","With pity","But I'm going to Cleveland","The pictures you paint aren't as pretty as they once seemed to me","And the coffee's bitter 'cause it's been boiling too long","And the jokes you tell aren't as funny as they once seemed to me","And the songs you sing are just plain hackneyed","But the stars shine down on all God's children","And the sun sets on the good and on the evil","And I know you","And I know you","The throbbing flowers outside, I get it","And the paint peeling from the bathroom walls","And the smile on your face, it's a lie","And the smile on your face, it's real pretty","And the sun shines down on all God's children","And the stars burn for the good and the evil","And I know you","And I know you","There was rain","There was wind","There was

all I remember","Later on","Near morning","We were talking","About nothing","A little rain","A little wind","A quiet hall","Cold air coming in","You were warm and that's all I remember","And your arms were warm and that's all I remember","And your eyes were pretty and that's all I remember","And your hands were soft and that's all I remember","And the hall was well-lit as I walked down it and that's all I remember","And the rain was light and it felt soft on my face and that's all I remember","And the car was quiet inside and that's all I remember","And it was talk but the sunlight was coming and that's all I remember","You bought me some candy","And you bought me some flowers","And you bought me a sofa","And you bought me a radio","Thank you for the candy","Thank you for the flowers","Thank you for the sofa","Thank you for the radio","Now I have everything I need","Now I have everything I need","You bought me a puppy","And you bought me a lamp","And you bought me some books","And you bought me a filing cabinet","Thank you for the puppy","Thank you for the lamp","Thank you for the books","Thanks for the filing cabinet, I don't know what I did without it","Now I have everything I need","Now I have everything I need","You came by and you came in","And you let the wind in, it must be cold outside","We looked out through the sliding glass door","But I'd forgotten what we were looking for","Thank you for coming by","It's nice to see you once in a while","And thank you for the coat I'd forgot to mention","I've been freezing in here, I've been freezing in here","Now I have everything I need","Now I have everything I need","Now I have everything I need","Now I have everything I need","Yeah","I'm coming in, try to stop me","Push furniture in front of the door","It only gives me something to push against","In the full heat of the summer's day","You're telling me to go away","But you owe me eight thousand dollars and I could use it","I'm only getting stronger, you may have noticed","But a head full of memories propels me ever forward","And in the living room I don't see where you are","But the back door's locked so you can't have gone far","And eight thousand dollars is a whole lot of money and I could use it","Could be that it's my imagination, but I think I hear you now","So come out, come out, wherever you are","Olly olly olly olly olly olly oxen free","See I'm perfectly aware of where our love stands","But the plain fact is that you owe me eight grand","If it helps to jog your memory I lent it to you one Tuesday when we were drinking","Ha","Ha ha ha ah aha","Aha aha ah ah aha","Haha hahaha aha aha ah aha","Aha aha","The sea gobbles up the full sun, and I","I look at you and I know you're the one","The one I used to know something about","And I try to say what it was, but the words won't come out","And you ask me to hold you","That's the devil's work","You show your palms and I see they're empty","And I'd check them twice if you'd let me","But you wouldn't do that now, would you","I didn't think so","And you ask me to hold you","But that's the devil's work","We stand on the sand and we watch the world turn","And we stand on the sand and we watch the water burn","And we stand on the sand six inches from one another","And the sands burn and blow but neither one of us runs for cover","And you ask me to hold you","That's the devil's work","And you ask me to hold you","But that's the devil's work","Toward the end of our first year in Las Vegas","You looked up from your little corner","And I saw that your face was getting a little brighter","And you asked me, is it really getting warmer","Or is it just me, and then you started mumbling unintelligibly","So what are you saying anyway","I thought I heard bells ringing, but then I remembered","That I no longer knew what bells sounded like","I thought we'd maybe strike up a conversation","'Til bad luck cruised by on his ten-speed bike","I got real cold and I grabbed my coat","And I saw that the ringing was coming from your throat","What are you saying anyway","You bought me a rabbit to keep me company","And I'm here in my car and the rabbit's here with me","Heading out Highway 1 respecting posted speed limits","And I tried to figure this one out but I can't find any meaning in it","And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures","And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean","I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu","And he'll chew on sourgrass while I bolt down Dexedrine","Dexedrine","The wind comes through the open window and I button my shirt","And the rabbit's riding shotgun, my teeth hurt","You sent me a package marked 'live animals inside'","And the sun's coming up quickly above the rising tide","And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure our your gestures","And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean","I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu","And he'll chew on sourgrass while I bolt down Dexedrine","Dexedrine","Big birds in the trees","Car's locked and I've lost my keys","Crashing sounds of the waterfall","And a statue of Jesus 200 feet tall","Three thousand miles from the port in California","And three little feet from falling off the earth","And the shadow of a mountain should cast a shadow","And the snow underfoot is soft and yielding","La la la la la la la la","La la la la la la la la","La la la la la la la la","Look at those birds","I'd say something about them but I've lost the words","They're laughing and they're watching me","And the radiator's boiling for no reason","The wild cattle crossing as it strikes their fancy","And a handful of money which does me no good","And a pocketful of medicine to abuse myself with","And a photograph of someone stapled to my shirt seam","La la la la la la la la","La la la la la la la la","La la la la la la la la","Sail on down the road","About half a mile or so","Well, I tried to make you stay","But now you're going","It was plain to see","That a small-town boy like me","Just wasn't your cup of tea","That was wishful thinking","Gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy","You gave me nothing in return","You know it ain't so hard to say","Would you please just go away","You come to comfort me","But I don't need your sympathy","And the way you look at me","Well, it's condescending","I feel my stomach churn","And didn't you ever learn","Not to tell somebody something","If you don't mean it","I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy","You gave me nothing in return","You know it ain't so hard to say","Would you please just go away","Sail on","Sail on","Sail on","I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom","I see the flags are flying high","I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room","I guess you're trying to cut off my air supply","I came toward your window real slowly","I knew deep down I was about to strike oil","I guess by now the flowers in your garden know me","I felt them trying to get at me through the soil","My bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt moving up my ankles","But I don't fear you","The thorns began tearing at my shirt","But I didn't even care when they tore clear through","Your garden can't hurt me","Your flowers don't threaten my life","Your garden can't hurt me anymore","Your flowers don't threaten my life","There was the sound of a lake boiling over","On that day","Everyone said just to sit still","But the thickening air got in my way","So the hook's been baited now","Yeah, the cheese is on the water","Yeah, the water's been cleansed of all impurities, but","But now it really doesn't matter","Let's go, let's go","Wisconsin bound","Wisconsin bound","Wisconsin bound","Wisconsin bound","The bottom of the boat was a hot plate come alive","But the boat wasn't real and this is how I feel","You don't know where you are until you arrive","And the frogs sang out from the distant banks","And you say you need me in California but no thanks","Wisconsin bound","Wisconsin bound","Wisconsin bound, yeah","Wisconsin bound","Let's go","I hear you moving in the hallway","I hear you sharpening your claws","I hear you polishing your teeth sometimes","But I don't mind","And I hear you out in the garage","I hear you messing with the motor","I hear you tinker with the engine sometimes","But I don't mind","And I hear you moving in the kitchen","I hear you in there late at night","I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes","But I don't mind","The house was pretty and the yard was wide","And I felt strong with you at my side","Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them","And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them","Ah, but you made me drink poison","It felt smooth running down my throat","I love you, and you made me drink poison","It was cool and smooth and sweet, do you remember","We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard","And I quit my job so I could hold you all the time","I tried to stop the thing metastasizing in us","But in the warm, slow evening, I could feel it rising in us","Ah, and you made me drink poison","It felt so smooth sliding down my throat","I love you so much, and you made me drink poison","It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool and smooth and sweet and cool and smooth","The sun was coming up and our friend was sound asleep","But we saw through the window that the water ran so deep","That you couldn't make out the ocean floor","Then I saw you in the light, I couldn't take it anymore","Give me your hand","Give me everything you've got","And the light from the window will fall on us burning hot","Just like a torch","The air was humid, I will not forget","When we stepped outside I hear your footstep","Now in my mind, it's a soft sound","Almost imperceptible against the giving ground","Let me kiss your eyelids with my lips","Let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips","Just like a torch","You've been away for quite some time","And now the rules are different now, everything's mine","Backtrack, hey say, what's the problem","Here's the problem, everything's mine","I can't be quiet","I can't be quiet anymore","I can't be quiet","I can't be quiet anymore","Yeah","You've been away for quite some some time","And now the rules are different now, everything's mine","Backtrack, hey, what's the problem","Here's the problem, everything's mine","I can't be quiet","Bang, pow, look at me now","Don't let the cows stray off too far","Come down, take a good look around","See how the cows start to shine like lightbulbs","I love the cows","I love the cows","I love the cows, yeah","I love the cows","Rain comes, strikes you dumb","Reseed the meadow so the cows don't starve","Mud puddle, it's a fine place to cuddle if","You're a mosquito or a mosquito's baby","I love the cows","I love the cows","I love the cows","I love the cows","They're smiling in your face","All the time they want to take your place","Yeah, you know who I

the morning","And the chickens were screaming","Black dog at my heels","And the bluejays were coughing","Up in the trees","I'd forgotten my name","I felt kind of ashamed","And felt myself burn in the morning","I saw you at your window","At the beginning of summer","And invisible stars","Sent their heat down","I imagined your touch","It was almost too much","Burned like a bonfire in the morning","I saw you","I saw your hair","I could spend the rest of my life in there","I saw you and I sank into your eyes","I'm not going to apologize","Because you with your own hands made the whole world","You

seen","We saw the world passing by","There was an ocean's droning","Though we were nowhere near the shore","We heard each other giggling and moaning","Then we couldn't hear each other anymore","Yeah","When my head was resting on your breastbone","I could hear your beating heart","Twenty-four hours later you had left me completely alone","I heard the whole world come apart","And you were all dressed in green","Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star","You know, you know what I mean","Yeah, I remember who you are","Water came springing out the side of the wall","And I guess the same thing will happen to us all","I don't know how to explain what I mean","I mean to say it's kind of hard to explain","Now","Let them kill me","Let them kill me","Let them kill me","Let them kill me","Water came down through the cracks in the ceiling","But this time the water had a different feeling","It's the sort of feeling that is hard to explain","So let me put it to you in a different

reflected on the ocean","Deadly blue","Yeah, I used to know you","I used to know you","I used to know you","I used to know you","Sun flashing red and then orange then opting for secession","On the day when you come to the door with your terrible confession","And I know you've come to take my toys away","And I know you've come to take my toys away","Skin flushing red and then glowing when you come inside","And the moonlight washing all over you, I have got my mouth open wide","And I know you've come to take my toys away","And I know you've come to take my toys away","Oh and when it drops you're gonna feel it","Oh, oh, yeah","Oh, oh, yeah"]
