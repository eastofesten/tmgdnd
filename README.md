A work-in-progress Twitter bot combining the Mountain Goats and Dungeons & Dragons. V1 launched 10 October 2018, V2 launched 2 December 2018.

"whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through [@mountain_goats](http://www.twitter.com/mountain_goats) to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds." this bot works with 5e rules/logic.
